1 API -> doPayment
Request Body -> all the required details

API would be called from OrderService

Order -> Payment -> PG -> payment link is received, open the link to pay

1. What details are received from the order service ?
2. Once we get the entry to payment service, before calling PG,
insert a payment entry inside the Payment table in Payment Service
3. Once the payment is done, we will have callback URL on payment service
4. This callback will update the entry we made earlier when payment
request was done
5. Extra calls we need to do will be in the flow of callback URL
